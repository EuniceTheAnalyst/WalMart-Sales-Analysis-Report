## Walmart Stores Sales Report  
### Executive Summary  
This report provides a deep-dive analysis of Walmart’s store sales data across various temporal, economic, and environmental factors. With total sales amounting to $6.74 billion, covering 21.61K total fuel price units, and 148,000 stores, the dashboard offers crucial insights into sales behaviors over time, during holidays, and across different regions and conditions.  
  
The objective of this analysis is to uncover actionable intelligence from the visualized data, focusing on sales performance, external economic indicators (like unemployment, CPI, fuel price), and environmental factors (such as temperature).

### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
**1.1 Total Sales**  
$6.74 billion in cumulative sales marks strong performance.  

Weekly sales fluctuate between $48M to $81M, as seen in the Total Sales by Date visual.  
  
**1.2 Fuel Price**  
Total Fuel Price is logged at 21.61K across the period.

Fuel price variations appear to have a noticeable inverse relationship with weekly sales (explored in Section 3).

**1.3 Number of Stores**  
The data covers 148,000 store records, representing a broad operational scope and national retail footprint.  
  
### 2. Sales Trends Over Time  
**2.1 Total Sales by Date**  
Weekly sales peaked at $81M on 24-12-2010, indicating a strong holiday season impact.  
  
A general downward trend is observed across the timeline, with sales declining steadily to around $50M by mid-2012.  
  
This may indicate seasonal impacts, market saturation, or external economic pressure affecting consumer spending over time.  
  
### 3. External Economic Indicators  
**3.1 Total CPI (Consumer Price Index) by Date**  
CPI fluctuates slightly from 7943 to 7906, suggesting a mildly deflationary environment.  
  
A falling CPI typically implies lower consumer prices, but it appears to have minimal impact on weekly sales.  

**3.2 Fuel Price vs. Sales**   
Visual comparison shows:  

Fuel price spikes (e.g., reaching 180) coincide with sales drops, e.g., $54M.  

Lower fuel prices (e.g., 126) align with higher sales, e.g., $81M.  

This suggests that fuel costs are inversely related to sales, likely due to their impact on consumer transportation costs and disposable income.  

**3.3 Unemployment and Weekly Sales**    
The scatterplot reveals:  

As unemployment increases beyond 7%, weekly sales decrease, with fewer instances of sales above $2M.  

Unemployment under 6% shows higher weekly sales, reinforcing the correlation between employment rate and consumer spending.  

This data suggests macroeconomic conditions significantly affect Walmart’s sales.  

### 4. Environmental Factors   
**4.1 Total Sales by Temperature**  
Sales are highest between temperatures of 40°F to 70°F.  

At extremes (below 20°F or above 90°F), weekly sales drop.  

This suggests that moderate weather encourages consumer activity, while extreme weather likely limits foot traffic or reduces store visits.  

### 5. Holiday Influence  
**5.1 Avg Sales by Holiday Flag**  
Holiday Sales: $1.04M (48.11%)  

Non-Holiday Sales: $1.12M (51.89%)  

Surprisingly, non-holiday weeks slightly outperform holiday weeks in average sales.  

This may be due to:  

More frequent non-holiday weeks in the dataset  

Potential stock shortages or logistical issues during holidays  

However, specific dates like 24-12-2010 (Christmas week) show strong spikes, suggesting that some holidays outperform overall averages.  

### 6. Store-Level Performance  
**6.1 Total Weekly Sales by Store**  
A large variation is observed across stores:  

Top-performing stores approach $0.3 billion in weekly sales.  

Several stores record under $0.05 billion, showing potential underperformance.  

This suggests disparities in:  

Store size  

Customer demographics  

Regional economics  

Marketing or inventory effectiveness  

Action Point: Identify top 10 and bottom 10 stores for targeted audits and benchmarking.    

### 7. Correlation & Cross-Factor Insights  
**7.1 CPI vs Sales**  
CPI appears relatively stable; it is not a primary factor in sales fluctuations.  
  
**7.2 Fuel Price & Unemployment**  
Combined impact: When fuel prices rise and unemployment is high, sales tend to drop more sharply.  

Suggests Walmart’s revenue is sensitive to macroeconomic volatility.  
  
**7.3 Temperature & Holidays**  
Peak temperature ranges (60–70°F) align with high sales weeks, including holidays.  

This indicates the synergistic effect of favorable weather and seasonal events on consumer behavior.  

**8. Strategic Recommendations**  
Based on the insights from the dashboard:  
  
A. Regional and Store Optimization  
Focus on top-performing stores to replicate success factors (staffing, layout, promotions).  

Investigate underperforming stores for issues like inventory management, customer experience, or local competition.  

B. Mitigate Economic Sensitivity  
Develop pricing strategies or bundle offers during high fuel cost periods.  
  
Consider fuel-linked discounts or promotions to encourage spending during inflationary periods.  
  
C. Tailor Operations by Weather  
Use weather forecasts to:  
  
Adjust inventory (e.g., stock seasonal items)  
  
Schedule promotional events  

Enhance delivery options during extreme temperatures  
  
D. Reevaluate Holiday Strategy  
Although holidays boost specific dates, average holiday sales underperform.  
  
Invest in:  

Better holiday marketing  

Supply chain optimization  

Pre-holiday campaigns to spread demand over weeks  
  
E. Leverage Unemployment Data  
Identify regions with high unemployment and introduce:  
  
Budget-focused marketing  
  
Layaway plans or discount cards  
  
Community outreach and engagement programs  
  
Conclusion  
Walmart's sales performance reflects strong overall revenue, but with clear sensitivity to economic and environmental factors. Sales are driven not only by product availability and pricing but also by external forces like unemployment, fuel prices, and weather. Strategic alignment with these patterns can significantly enhance performance.  
  
This analysis underscores the importance of a holistic, data-driven approach in retail strategy, blending operational insights with macroeconomic awareness.
